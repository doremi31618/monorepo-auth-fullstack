# 📊 Roadmap Planning Review Report
Date: 2025-12-05

## 1. Project System Status Analysis
After analyzing the file structure and configuration of the `monorepo-system-template` project, the current status is as follows:

| Item | Current Status | Observation |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| **Monorepo Architecture** | ❌ Not enabled | Root directory lacks `package.json` / `nx.json` / `turbo.json`. Currently just `backend` + `frontend` folders. |
| **Backend Architecture** | ⚠️ Flat Structure | Modules (`auth`, `user`, `config`) are at `src/` root. No `core/domain` or `core/infra` separation yet. |
| **Frontend Architecture** | ✅ Standard | SvelteKit + Vite, structure is standard and ready. |
| **Milestone 0 (Auth)** | ✅ Likely Complete | `auth` module and `user` module coexist. Basic functional structure seems present. |
| **Milestone 1 (Core)** | ⏳ Pending | The planned "Core Layering" and "Nx Workspace" are the correct next steps. |

## 2. Roadmap Content Review (doc/Roadmap)

### 👍 What's Good
- **Goal is Clear**: Moving towards a strict Layered Architecture (Domain vs Infra) is excellent for long-term maintenance.
- **Detailed Specs**: Milestones (especially M3 CMS & M4 System) are very detailed with clear deliverables.
- **Progression**: The sequence M0 (Auth) -> M1 (Arch) -> M2 (Admin) is logical.

### 💡 Suggested Adjustments

#### 1️⃣ M1: Split "Nx Initialization" and "Refactoring"
Currently, M1 includes both *Tooling Setup* (Nx) and *Code Refactoring* (Core structure). These are both heavy tasks.
**Recommendation**:
- Create a **Pre-M1** or **M1-Phase 1**: "Monorepo Initialization".
- Goal: Initialize Nx/Turborepo, set up root `package.json`, ensure `pnpm` workspaces work, and setup shared CI tasks *before* moving code.
- **Why**: Moving files in a non-monorepo setup can break imports silently. Having Nx/Turbo first helps track dependencies.

#### 2️⃣ M1: Add "Migration Strategy" for Existing Modules
You already have `auth` and `user` modules in `backend/src`.
**Recommendation**:
- Add a specific step in M1: "Migrate existing Auth/User modules to Domain/Infra".
- Explicitly define:
    - `src/user` -> `src/core/domain/user`
    - `src/auth` -> `src/core/infra/auth` (or keep as Feature Module depending on logic)
    - `src/db/schema.ts` -> Split into `core/domain/x/x.schema.ts`

#### 3️⃣ M1: Development Scripts
Root directory has a `scripts` folder. M1 should include checking these scripts and integrating them into the Monorepo task runner (e.g., `nx run-many`).

## 3. Conclusion
The Roadmap is **Accurate** and strictly needed. The project is currently in a "Pre-Monorepo" state. Implementing M1 is the critical blocker to unlocking M2 (Admin) and M3 (CMS).

**Analysis Result**: No major changes to Roadmap *goals* needed, but **M1 execution steps** should be prioritized: **Nx Init -> then Refactor**.
